3074	DANCE	 125S	AMERICAN MUSICALS	What is it about musicals that made them a uniquely American theatrical form? In this course, we will investigate how musicals represent what it means to be American. Musical theatre history is American history, indebted to and reflective of critical histories of appropriation, capitalism, immigration, and popular entertainment. Musicals seduce us in song and dance; it is easy to ignore the substance beneath the sequins. We will study the texts and historical contexts of musicals over the past century, from Shuffle Along, and Oklahoma!, to A Chorus Line, and Hamilton. Musicals reveal shifting notions of what 'American' means as they stage ability, ethnicity, gender, race, and sexuality.	(ALP) Arts, Literature & Performance

Using a global health humanities approach, we study illness and disability through biography, poetry, blogs, and art created by patients, families, friends, doctors, and caregivers. We look beyond data to find meaning through documentaries, theories of representation, and illness narratives. We explore different illness experiences, such as HIV/AIDS and Ebola; different disabilities, such as physical and cognitive; different gender identities and ages; and different locations, such as South Africa, West Africa, Papua New Guinea, Brazil, Haiti, and rural and urban USA.

It impacts communities and raises fundamental questions about life. Exploring amorous discourse from two millennia –Plato's erotic ascent, Virgil's deceived Dido, Ovid's rules of seduction, Boccaccio's legitimation of female desire, Michelangelo's homoerotic poetry, Leonardo's sublimated impulses, Foscolo's tragic obsession, comic uncertainties of Svevo's modern lovers, and love from afar in Montale—we will see what changes, what persists, and ultimately come to understand what we mean when we talk about love today.

It begins by exploring the nature of poverty through a variety of descriptive metaphors (for example, poverty as a 'trap' or a 'disease'). It then considers the word 'we,' and in doing so introduces several basic understandings of ethics (deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, etc.) Finally it considers the word 'fix' and offers three models for responding to poverty: working for, working with, and being with. Each model explores several examples of good practice followed by critical reflection as students engage with opportunities in Durham displaying each approach.	(CCI) Cross Cultural Inquiry

24214	THEATRST	209	HOW MUSICALS WORK	What makes a musical a musical? How do musicals create alchemy in song and dance? What is the relationship between content, form, and context? These questions will guide our study of musical theater dramaturgy and its evolution. We will cover everything from contemporary musicals to Sondheim, rock operas, revues, and Rodgers & Hammerstein. By the end of the course, students will become experts at recognizing various forms of musical theatre, gain an understanding of the pivotal relationship between historical context and dramatic form, and be able to chart how innovations often become conventions. Our focus is musical theater on the page and the stage as we explore how musicals work.	(ALP) Arts, Literature & Performance

24601	POLSCI	 189FS	INTRO TO MACHINE LEARNING	Our goal as social scientists is to build models of the world and provide advice to policy makers. Given that human actors are often strategic and the games they play are complex, building and testing these models is difficult and distinct from common examples of machine learning. A task that is often used to motivate introductions to machine learning is teaching a model to recognize hand-written characters using MNIST data (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist). Our task is harder: we must build models that involve forecasting human behavior ranging from votes in a legislature to changes in stock prices.	(R) Research

24692	CMAC	252	LEARNING TO FAIL	Most people spend their lives afraid of failing. Yet, many of the world's most successful people failed numerous times on their paths toward success. The underlying question of this class is if failing is as antithetical to learning as we're taught to believe. To explore this question, we will test ways of using failure as a strategy for learning. We will experiment with failure to learn how it can make us better as we develop our skills as innovators, specifically focusing on the earliest stage of creativity: ideation. We will use failure through experimentation as a technique for problem definition and needs discovery which, in turn, will help us validate the quality of our ideas.	(SS) Social Sciences

24693	CMAC	253	SOCIAL MARKETING	Typical Duke students spend hours each day using social media. You've surely heard the platforms described as 'revolutionary,' and you've also heard them described as 'time wasters.' What you probably haven't thought about is how similar they are to previous 'revolutionary' communications technologies like novels, newspapers, and even language itself. This course explores ways in which studying the masters of previous 'social' media technologies—the Shakespeares, Whitmans, and Eliots of the world—can help us understand how influencers on digital social media leverage the same platforms you use every day to market themselves, build their brands, and grow their audiences.

25017	RELIGION	 266S	HARRY POTTER AND RELIGION	This course explores the response of many Christians to the Harry Potter book series. Some theologically conservative Protestants have claimed that the Potter books contain satanic messages, promote witchcraft, and celebrate practices of the occult. By contrast, many supporters of the books insist they positively convey Christian messages. By investigating the debate, 'Harry Potter & Religion' also examines the history of thought concerning 'magic' and 'religion,' the sometimes blurred boundaries between religion and science, and the place of technologies of enchantment in all of the above--magic, religion, and science alike.

25054	HISTORY	120	HISTORY OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY	This course explores the sweep of US political history. In the process, it encourages participants to think critically about what 'democracy' is, how it works, and what its vulnerabilities are. We look at the history of electoral politics in the United States, exploring the ways in which politicians have both empowered and disempowered voters. We examine grass-roots efforts to gain greater power in shaping common life—and attempts to suppress those efforts. Throughout, we explore how people's concepts of 'democracy' have clashed and changed, and we examine how past conflicts have given rise to the political crises and opportunities of our own time.

25242	PHIL	 124FS	FREEDOM AND MORAL OBLIGATION	Are moral obligations limitations on our freedom, or are they, as some philosophers have insisted, the fullest expression of freedom? To understand the disagreement, we'll look at moral obligations, particularly social and political obligations. How do collective moral obligations, like climate change or reparations for slavery, obligate us individually—or do they? Is freedom of speech morally required? Finally, we will consider Kant's Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, in which Kant argued that we are only free when our actions are dictated entirely by morality.	(CZ) Civilizations

To many, it feels like we're in the middle of a cultural civil war that is turning violent. Those with whom we have deep disagreements, assuming we interact with them at all, are often viewed as not just wrong but as irrational, immoral, even contemptible. Is this a good thing? What sort of habits of mind (e.g. intellectual humility and charity) and practices should we cultivate in response to this reality in order to sustain a healthy democracy? Special attention paid to the university, cancel culture, free speech, social media, and identity politics. Lively discussion is encouraged.	(CZ) Civilizations

27305	AMES	267	SPIRITUAL BUT NOT RELIGIOUS	This course address one of the most pressing questions in the study of religion today: What does it mean to be 'spiritual but not religious'? This is a question that frequently appears in survey research; about a quarter of U.S. adults 'now say they think of themselves as spiritual but not religious' (Pew). In this course, we address the big questions about how to define 'religion' and 'spirituality,' and we use empirical data to acquire a new understanding of the lived experience of people who are 'spiritual but not religious,' not only in the United States, but also in Asia and other parts of the world.

27437	I&E	350	CUSTOMER EMPATHY BRAND DESIGN	Before Dollar Shave Club, we went to Target to save on Gillette. We still buy traditional brands at traditional stores. But a host of these disruptors are cutting out the middleman while redefining brick-and-mortar retail. Amazon now gets us whatever we want, whenever and wherever we want it. Dollar Shave Club quickly amassed 3 million subscribers. These 'direct-to-consumer' brands control every customer interaction. These brands become as much about that experience as about the product itself. This requires customer empathy. Armed with these insights, we can create brands that reframe peoples' category expectations and, in best cases, enhance their lives.	(SS) Social Sciences

How do you decide what to do, which instructions to rely on? Policy making in a fast-moving epidemic (such as the COVID-19) can often look like this. This course will help students understand: Where does data for policy come from? How is data on epidemics generated and synthesized? Why does data become controversial … what is the 'truth'? Responding to data – differences between clinical settings and population settings. How does data inform policy – or more precisely, why does it not inform policy. How can future leaders do better?

27811	HISTORY	138	FROM STALIN TO PUTIN	When the Soviet Union ceased to exist, many believed that Russia's history of autocratic rule might finally end. Today Russia under Putin appears to be retreating from democracy. Putin's rule is routinely compared to a dictatorship.

28659	AADS	 382S	INTIMACIES	A deep dive into the theoretical concept of intimacy, this seminar touches upon the racial, sensorial, and sexual life of nations and the state. Through discussions about citizenship, religion, migration, political economy, belonging, community, and activism, we consider what it means for bodies to exist in relation not only to other bodies, but also within the larger body of the nation-state. We examine theoretical writing alongside film, performance and installation art, law, and pop culture, bringing sexuality to bear on indigenous genocide, the Antebellum South, anti-immigration and miscegenation law, US militarism in Asia and the Pacific, LGBTQ rights, and political scandal.

28790	RELIGION	 204S	NEOPAGANISM AND WITCHCRAFT	Neopaganism and Witchcraft investigate the religious phenomenon loosely called Neopaganism – an inventive mixture of New Age religions, Witchcraft, Druidism, Wicca, Earth Religions, and non-Native American Shamanism. The course focus on practices principally in Europe and the United States for a particular set of reasons. Christianity and its pagan others have played a critical role in the history of modern European and American imagination of the nation-state. Race, religion, and native soil are key aspects of neopaganism's embattled self-concept, particularly in the context of globalization and the perceived menace of multi-ethnic West.

28875	DOCST	 331S	US WOMEN’S HEALTH POST-ROE	The overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022 led to the deaths of two women in South Carolina. One woman died from sepsis following self-instrumentation, and the second died after giving birth to a healthy baby. She began to hemorrhage; hospital administrators were afraid that the 'D&C' she needed to survive was too close to the abortion procedure. A physician team at Duke University Hospitals, led by Dr. Beverly Clark, began to see similar cases in North Carolina. The aim of this course is to document—in real time—the political and ethical dimensions of the situation that healthcare providers now find themselves in as they attempt to provide women the nationwide medical 'standard of care.'

28875	RIGHTS	 337S	US WOMEN’S HEALTH POST-ROE	The overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022 led to the deaths of two women in South Carolina. One woman died from sepsis following self-instrumentation, and the second died after giving birth to a healthy baby. She began to hemorrhage; hospital administrators were afraid that the 'D&C' she needed to survive was too close to the abortion procedure. A physician team at Duke University Hospitals, led by Dr. Beverly Clark, began to see similar cases in North Carolina.

28879	CLST	277	HOW TO RULE THE WORLD	From Babylon and Persia to Greece and Rome, empires have risen and fallen, but they always seem to make a comeback. Their defenders point to the stability they bring to a chaotic world. Their detractors point to the harsh rule required to maintain them. This course will explore arguments for and against empire, drawing on history, philosophy, and political theory, with a special focus on the Greeks and Romans. Then, in light of the parallel problems of empire and global governance, we will ask what lessons we can learn for the practice of international affairs today. Contemporary topics will include global institutions, foreign intervention, East Asia policy, and NATO and Eastern Europe.	(CCI) Cross Cultural Inquiry

29095	ARTHIST	337	THE ART OF GARDENS	This course explores the history of garden and landscape design through a series of case studies beginning with ancient gardens of the Mediterranean and Near East and ending with the Sarah P. Duke gardens. Students will explore how landscapes were shaped to meet the aesthetic, agricultural, and social needs of a range of different cultures and time periods. Among the themes explored are the tension between the natural environment and human intervention and the religious, philosophical, and cultural significance of garden design. The class will culminate in a detailed study of Duke gardens, in which students will digitally map and conduct research into a portion of the gardens.	(ALP) Arts, Literature & Performance

29101	AAAS	 376S	LOVE, SEX, MADNESS	This course explores the themes of love, sex, and madness as the lenses through which Caribbean writers and filmmakers have challenged traditional ideas of citizenship, family, gender roles, and political power. What, for example, is the connection between a dictatorship in Haiti and women's sexual desire? How does the figure of 'the mad Creole woman' challenge masculinist constructions of national identity in the early years of independence in Africa? How might the love between a mother and child be read as an act of anti-colonial resistance? We will examine these questions through novels, short stories, and films.

29263	COMPSCI	 247S	HUMAN FLOURISHING, DIGITAL AGE	The digital age has enhanced human life in many ways: communication is faster, medicine is better, and our knowledge of the world is deeper. But it has also changed the nature of work, society, and our sense of well-being, and raised fundamental questions about the meaning and purpose of human life. This course asks what it means for humans to flourish in a digital age. It considers how new technologies through the centuries have impacted human flourishing, making certain aspects easier and others harder, and perhaps even altering our conception of what flourishing looks like. Our ultimate goal is to ponder together how we should practically live in today's digital age. For sophomores only.	(CZ) Civilizations
